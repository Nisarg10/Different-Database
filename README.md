1. What is your external data source used to populate your Heroku data sources?
        
      I have used data of New York City Leading Causes of Death from http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/new-york-city-leading-causes-of-death-ce97f. From this I have used following columns.
            - Ethnicity
            - Sex
            - Cause Of Death
            - Year
            - id (This one is not used from data, I manually created the unique id for each recoed.)
    
2. What are the Heroku toolbelt commands to execute the scripts?
3. What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
4. What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
